# hello-world
wow first repository so cool

This is my first repository. Some goals that I have for myself moving forward:
-Practice coding again
-Create a program by myself with some help from online guides (or maybe all by myself!)
-Develop a stronger vocabulary regarding technical terms
-Become a Github pro (or at least not a complete beginner)
